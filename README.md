# String_buffer
## clearing buffer 
A temporary storage area is called a buffer. All standard input and output devices contain an input and output buffer.
In standard C/C++, streams are buffered. For example, in the case of standard input, when we press the key on the keyboard,
it isnâ€™t sent to your program, instead of that  it is send to the buffer by the operating system, till the time is allotted to that program.
